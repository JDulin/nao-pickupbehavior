SATE 2012 Project: Humanoid Robotics with NAO 
Prototype Application for NAO

This is all of the code, test data, and documentation that came out of my 2012 summer internship with the Air Force
Research Lab and TecEdge's Summer-at-the-Edge program.  The research project's goal was to develop applications
of the NAO robot's functionality to a real world environment. I tried to build an application to have NAO search a room for
an object and pick it up.  More advanced applications would have involved multiple objects, obscured objects, and a pulled
wagon that NAO would collect objects in.
