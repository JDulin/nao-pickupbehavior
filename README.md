SATE 2012 Project: Humanoid Robotics with NAO 
Pickup Application for NAO

This is all of the code, test data, and documentation that came out of my 2012 summer internship with the Air Force
Research Lab and TecEdge's Summer-at-the-Edge program.  The research project's goal was to develop applications
of the NAO robot's functionality to a real world environment. I tried to build an application to have NAO search a room for
an object and pick it up.  More advanced applications would have involved collection a set of objects, obscured objects, and
(super-cool pipe-dream) a wagon that NAO would pull around and collect the objects in.

Many thanks to Dr. Robert Williams of the AFRL and Dr. Greg Lee of the CWRU EECS department for their
expertise, encouragement, ingenuity, and, of course, hardware.
